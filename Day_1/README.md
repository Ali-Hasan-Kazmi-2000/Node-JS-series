This is a simple Node.js script that creates an HTTP server listening on port 3000. When a request is made to the server, the script logs the request object to the console.

This code does not send any response back to the client, so if you were to make a request to this server using a web browser or a tool like cURL, you would not see any output in the browser or terminal window. You could modify the code to send a response back to the client by adding code to the callback function to write to the res object.
